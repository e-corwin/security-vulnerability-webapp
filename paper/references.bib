abstract = {Web design is still primarily an artistic endeavor. However, we are beginning to see empirical research results that tell us what pitfalls to avoid in order to create successful web sites.In this SIG, we will discuss the latest research results available. Web-site designers can share successful strategies and discuss questions still unanswered.This SIG also will be a forum for researchers to discuss methods and share objectives. Researchers will have an opportunity to interact with web-site designers to understand the research still required to identify the keys to successful design.Following the session, we intend to consolidate the discussion into a four-to-five page summary and send it to all participants.},
