### Replication Instructions
1. Install Python
    1. Download [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Any version later than 3.8.5 is acceptable.

2. Create Virtual Environment
     1. Create a project folder and a ```.venv``` folder within. Type the following terminal commands:
    ```
    $ mkdir Project
    $ cd Project
    $ python3 -m venv .venv
    ```


3. Activate the Environment
     1. Activate the corresponding environment before you work on your project.

4. Install Python Flask
     1. Within the activated environment, type the following command to install [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/installation/):
	```
	$ pip install Flask
	```

5. Install Requests
     1. Within the activated environment, use the following command to install the [Requests HTTP library](https://pypi.org/project/requests/):
    ```
    $ pip install requests
    Or 
    $ python -m pip install requests
    ```
     2. To upgrade requests to the latest version, type the following command:
    ```
	$ pip install --upgrade requests
	```

6. Cloning the GitHub Repository
     1. In the terminal or command prompt navigate to the Project folder you just created. Type the following command:
    ```
	$ cd Project
	```
     2. Clone the Git repository. Type the following command:
    ```
    $ git clone https://github.com/e-corwin/security-vulnerability-webapp.git
	```

 8. Requesting API Keys
      1. In order to retrieve data from the NIST NVD CVE database, you need an API key. Request from the following [form](https://nvd.nist.gov/developers/request-an-api-key).
      2. Create a new file called ```key_variable.py.``` Include the following line of code with your API key in this file:
    ```
    Headers = {'apiKey': 'insert API Key here'}
	```

9. Opening the Repository on Your Local Machine
     1. Open the files repository in VSCode or an IDE or code editor of your choice.

10. Loading the Dataset
     1. Run ```update_data.py``` to pull CVE data modified within the last month. 	If you want to pull CVE data modified within the last year, run:
    ```
    $ python update\_data.py -all
    ```
        You should see the following:
        ![update_data_terminal.png](update_data in the terminal)

Note that the number of results will likely be different from what is shown here. If this is your first time loading the dataset, new files cve-data-full.json and cisa-data-full.json will be created and populated with data. If this is not your first time loading the dataset, cve-data-full.json and cisa-data-full.json will be updated. 

10. Running the Web Application
     1. Run ```main.py```. You should see the following:
    ![app_run_terminal.png](Running the web application)
Paste the server the app is running on in a browser. I used Google Chrome. You should now see the Web application.
